# Remote_Keylogger

Some fun hacker-man stuff :P

There will be 2 computers, Hacker and Client. 

Firstly, the hacker_server.py file will be executed on the Hacker's machine.
Then the key_logger_client.py file will be executed on the client's machine.

Now whatever keys are pressed on the client's keyboard will be sent to the hacker's machine where this data will be written and stored in a text file (keylogs.txt). 

Data is sent from client to server using socket programming.
